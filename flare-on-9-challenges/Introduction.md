#Introduction to Flare-On 9 Challenge Write-ups

##Background
My name is Ramez Hatab and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering major at UT Austin. My skills are primarily software development focused, and with 2 cyber internships under my belt I am looking to broaden my skills and delve into the world of reverse engineering/malware analysis!

##Write-Ups
I acknowledge myself as a hands-on learner, so I figured the best way to do this would be to dive right in and complete some RE based CTFs, starting with Flare-On 9.
This is my first attempt at a CTF, so the write-ups in this folder will be me documenting my thought process and how I solve these challenges.
